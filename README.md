# Translation Web App using NLP and Gradio

## Overview

This project is a simple web app for translating English text to French using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Gradio. Gradio is a Python library that allows you to rapidly create UIs for machine learning models.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/translation-web-app.git
    cd translation_web_app_using_nlp_and_gradio-main
    ```
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook translation_web_app.ipynb
    ```

3. Open the notebook and run the cells to load the pretrained model and set up the translation functions.
4. Execute the cell with Gradio to launch the local web interface.
5. Visit the provided local URL in your web browser to access the translation web app.
